# Exquisiter #

## Summary ##
  > Exquisiter is a collaborative storytelling platform where you can write your own future, but also glimpse what might have been.

## Problem ##
  > The 'exquisite corpse' or round-robin story is a classic collaborative storytelling format where authors explore a narrative where no one is in complete control. But while the past is fixed, imaginary futures are plenitudinous. There is so much more than one narrative to explore.

## Solution ##
  > Exquisiter reimagines stories as a garden of forking paths. Users are authors, but also observers of the ways their stories might have unfolded if someone else had taken their place in the creative process.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Collaborative storytelling is such a powerful experience, we wanted to make that experience as big and expansive as possible to put more people in touch with one another."

## How to Get Started ##
  > All it takes to participate in Exquisiter is to read a phrase or sentence another author wrote, and add one of your own. From there you're free to explore all the corners of the story as it's unfolded, both those that led to your contribution and those that took a different path.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I thought I'd enjoy adding to stories the most, but some days I just get lost wandering through all the different versions people have made. The Exquisiter community is so unique. I've never seen anything like it!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > The best way understand Equisiter in all of its weird glory is to try it out. Contribute as much or as little as you like, and see not just where it goes, but where it might have gone.
